# Victoria McCabe Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I showcase my work as a software developer. Here, you'll find a variety of projects I've created using different web and programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and C#.

The purpose of this repository is to share my coding journey and demonstrate the skills I've acquired. I will be updating this repository regularly with new projects.

Feel free to explore the projects, and if you're interested in collaborating or have any feedback don't hesitate to reach out!
